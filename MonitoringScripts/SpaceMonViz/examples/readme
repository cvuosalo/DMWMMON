This directory contains data and examples for 
various monitoring helper scripts 

1) Alessandro's example to populate Elasticsearch with SpaceMon data. 

How to run the example:

$ python ../proc.py ex_lfn2pfn.js ex_dump3 dump4

Note: "dump4" is the output file

2) Natalia's example of aggregating timestamps into a predefined timebin.

To get spacemon data for all T1 sites from June 1, 2016 till current time:
 wget -no-check-certificate -O /tmp/T1_ALL_dumpspacequery_sinceJune2016_level-1.out "https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dmwmmon/datasvc/perl/dumpspacequery?node=T1*&level=1&time_since=1464739200"

perl  ../timebin.pl  /tmp/T1_ALL_dumpspacequery_sinceJune2016_level-1.out

will produce timebin for the 25th week of 2016 (June 20-26) and print out the approximated values of the storage volume for each node.
